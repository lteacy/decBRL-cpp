decBRL-cpp
==========

Decentralised Bayesian Reinforcement Learning Library, written in C++

Dependencies
============
This software currently depends on the random module of Boost (see http://www.boost.org/), and the maxsum-cpp library (see https://github.com/lteacy/maxsum-cpp).

doxygen is required to compile documentation in html. In addition, LaTeX is required to generate forumla's included in the html, and to generate a pdf version of the documentation.

Installation
============
Install CMake (see http://www.cmake.org/) and follow the general instructions for building CMake projects for your platform.
For example, on most unix-like platforms (including Mac OS X) it is usually sufficient to run the following commands:

    cd decBRL-cpp
    cmake .
    make

Optionally, to run unit tests:

    ctest .

And to build documentation:

    make doc

If your platform has multiple cores, both make and ctest can run in parallel, by specifying the number of cores on the command line.
For example, on a 4 core machine, run:

    make -j 4
    ctest -j 4

Known Issues
============
This library is not complete yet!! The initial phase of development is still underway, so there is nothing worthing linking to just yet.
